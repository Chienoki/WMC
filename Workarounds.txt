Common issues workarounds:

===============================================================================
If WMC does not find any tuners (HDHomerun):

restart the system
then put the system in sleep state
and then wake it back up

===============================================================================
Manually backup WMC settings for reinstall later:

#1 stop the WMC services (ehRecvr, ehSched, Mcx2Svc)

#2 copy the following folder in a safe place (ProgramData is a hidden folder):
"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome"

#3 open regedit.exe and export the following registry key to .reg file:
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Media Center"

# when installing WMC later and before starting it, check that the services are stopped
then import the .reg file, and copy the eHome folder back in place.

Simple guide for live TV setup by "GunnerHook":

1.  Do clean install of Win10 build 10240.

2.  Install HDHomerun tuner drivers.

3.  Download and install WMC pack.

4.  Open command prompt as administrator, and execute:
attrib -r C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts
notepad C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts

Add these 2 entries at the bottom if they don't exist:
2.16.216.176    cdn.epg.tvdownload.microsoft.com
65.55.186.113    data.tvdownload.microsoft.com

save the file, and reboot
 
5.  Right click and Launch WMC as admin for the very first setup of WMC
Go through the live setup on WMC, put in correct zipcode, finish all the basic steps of live tv setup in WMC.

6.  Install DVD player app (through WU or manually as descibed above)

7.  Add NETWORK service to the administrators group in order for scheduled recordings to start correctly.

8.  If you are using HDHomerun and you get no tv signal available for this channel, reinstall the HDhomerun drivers again AFTER the TV setup was completed in WMC.

===============================================================================
If the initial tv setup wizard stuck, reboot the system
then launch this file as administrator while WMC is running
C:\Windows\ehome\mcupdate.exe

===============================================================================

===============================================================================
If the search through guide in WMC fails with an error that indexing was still occuring,
Open an elevated command prompt, and execute:

reg delete "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Media Center\Service\EPG" /v SearchRegistered /f
net stop WSearch
cd %windir%\ehome
ehprivjob /DoRegisterSearch

===============================================================================
If you are having activation issues of the CableCard Product key:

when your activation fails, click back in the wizard
then open command prompt as administrator, and execute:
slmgr -ipk MVV4F-R2T29-WBHYJ-BBFQY-J64XX
slmgr -ato

then continue the wizard

===============================================================================
If you have Guide data download problems (specially US residents):

1.Open notepad (right click> run as administrator)

2.Open host file ( File>open> c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)

3.Add this to the end of the file-
2.16.216.176 cdn.epg.tvdownload.microsoft.com

and place one of the below ip addresses depending on your location in the US
west coast or east coast
65.55.186.113 data.tvdownload.microsoft.com
central or southern us
65.55.5.170 data.tvdownload.microsoft.com

ex. If you lived on the east coast you would add this to the bottom of the file:
65.55.186.113 data.tvdownload.microsoft.com
2.16.216.176 cdn.epg.tvdownload.microsoft.com 

4.Save the file (file>save)

5.Open CMD command prompt (file>search for cmd>right click>run as administrator)

6.Type: ipconfig /flushdns
If you type it correctly it should say: "successfully flushed the dns resolver cache."

7.Close Windows Media Center if it is open

8.Start>type "c:\ProgramData\Microsoft\ehome" 

9.Delete file "mcepg2-0" and folder "mcepg2-0" this will force you to set up live tv from scratch in WMC (or delete anything named m***.db and the corresponding folder)

10.Open windows media center and go through the Live TV setup and you should now be able to download guide data

===============================================================================
old-not-needed workaround, left for reference:

to make WMC wake up for recordings, you may need to make "NETWORK SERVICE" a member of the administrator group

Run lusrmgr.msc, or right-click on Start button and select: Computer Management > Local users & Groups
then:
Groups > Administrators > Add > "network service" > Check names > OK

or directly open command prompt as administrator:
for /f "usebackq delims=" %x in (`powershell "(New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier('S-1-5-32-544')).Translate([System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]).Value.Split([IO.Path]::DirectorySeparatorChar)[1]"`) do set "admins=%x"
for /f "usebackq delims=" %x in (`powershell "(New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier('S-1-5-20')).Translate([System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]).Value"`) do set "netsvc=%x"
net localgroup %admins% "%netsvc%" /add

Windows 10 Home edition don't have Group Policy, thus you need to try the command prompt directly
